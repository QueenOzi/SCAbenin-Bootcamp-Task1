    <div><h2>Java script Lesson 1</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT HOME</h3>
            JavaScript is easy language to learn. it is the
            programming language of HTML and the Web. Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used.
            Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Also Javascript and Java are completely different languages. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT INTRODUCTION</h3> Javascript can do a lot of things. Examples include <br>
             1. <b> Javascript can change HTML content:</b> One of the method is getElementById().This method is used  to "find" 
             an HTML element (with id="demo") and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript" <br>
             2. <b>It can change HTML attribute values</b> <br>
             3. <b>It can change HTML styles</b> <br>
             4. <b>It can show and hide HTML elements</b> <br>
              </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT WHERE TO</h3>  JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML. The javascript codes are inserted 
            in between the script tags. You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
            Scripts can be placed in the body or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.   
            Scripts can be placed in external files.
            External scripts can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT OUTPUT</h3> 
        Javascript can display data in different ways. This include: <br>
        1. <b>Using innerHTML</b> <br>
        2. <b>Using document.write()</b> <br>
        3. <b>Uding window.alert()</b> <br>
        4. <b>Using console.log()</b> <br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT STATEMENTS</h3>  JavaScript statements are composed of:
            Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments. The statements are executed, one by one, in the
             same order as they are written. JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript 
             action to be performed. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX</h3>  JavaScripts syntax are sets of rules that shows how JavaScript programs are
            constructed. The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values.
            Fixed values are called literals. Variable values are called variables.
             JavaScript is case sensitive. It uses strings, operators, expression, keyword and identifers.  </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT COMMENTS</h3>  In JavaScript comments are used to give explain JavaScript code and to make
             it more readable.
             <b> Single line comments start with //.</b>  <br>
             <b>Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.</b>
             Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
            
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES</h3> Variables are containers for storing data.
        All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
        These unique names are called identifiers.
        Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
        The equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operatorin JavaScript not an "equal to" operator.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT OPERATORS</h3>  There are various types 
        of operators. This include the assignment operator, increment operator, logical operator,
        expomentiation, string operators, comparison operators etc
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT ARITHMENTIC</h3> Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables). 
            Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.
            Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).
            And the precedence can be changed by using parentheses.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT ASSIGNMENT</h3> Assignment operators assign values to variables. These operators include =, +=,
        -=, *=, >>>= etc.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPES</h3> JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects etc.
        JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.
        It is important to note that JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS</h3> A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
        The function is executed when it called. It is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
        Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
        The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
        (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
        The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS</h3> JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.
        Objects are also variables. But objects can contain many values. The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
        In defining an object, spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines. <br>
        <b>Object Properties:</b> The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties. <br>
        Object properties can be accessed in two ways. <br>
           1. objectName.propertyName <br>
           2. objectName["propertyName"] <br> 
        <b>Object Methods:</b> Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. They are stored in properties as function definitions.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT EVENTS</h3> Events are "things" that happens.
        JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
        HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
        Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT STRINGS</h3> JavaScript strings are used for storing and manipulating text.
        A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes(It could be single''or double quotes "").
        But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword 'new'.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT STRING METHODS</h3> String methods helps to work with strings. There are different methods in carrying out operations like String length,
         Finding a string in a string, Searching for a string in a string and Extracting string parts.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT NUMBERS</h3> Numbers can be with or without decimals. Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponent) notation.
         Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits in JavaScript. <br>
         JavaScript uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation.
         Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.<br>
         <b>Numeric Strings:</b>
         JavaScript strings can have numeric content. Strings will be converted to numbers in all numeric operations except with the + operator.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT NUMBER METHODS</h3> Number methods help you work with numbers. There are a number of methods that can be use with Javascript.Examples are <br>
         <b>1. The toString() Method:</b> this method returns a number as a string.<br>
         <b>2. The toExponential() Method:</b> this method returns a string, with a number rounded and written using exponential notation.<br>
         <b>3. The toFixed() Method:</b>this method returns a string, with the number written with a specified number of decimals. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT ARRAYS</h3> JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. An array can be created using the syntax:
        var array_name = [item1, item2, ...]. An array can be accessed by using the index number. The indexes start with 0.[0] is the first element. 
        [1] is the second element.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT ARRAY METHODS</h3> <b>The toString() method and The join() method</b> converts an array to a string of array values.
         Popping items out of an array can be achieved by using <b>The pop() method </b> which removes the last element from an array. Pushing items
         can be achieved by using <b>The push() method </b> which adds a new element to an array (at the end).
         <b>The shift() method</b> removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index. There are other methods that can be applied
         to and array such as the <b>unshift() method, splice(), concat(), slice() </b>etc.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT ARRAY SORT</h3><b>The sort() method</b> sorts an array alphabetically. <b>The reverse() method </b>reverses the elements in an array.
         It can also be used to sort an array in descending order.
        </p>
    </div>
