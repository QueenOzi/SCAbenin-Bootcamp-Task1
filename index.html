        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT HOME</h3>
            JavaScript is easy language to learn. it is the
            programming language of HTML and the Web. Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used.
            Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Also Javascript and Java are completely different languages. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT INTRODUCTION</h3> Javascript can do a lot of things. Examples include <br>
             1. <b> Javascript can change HTML content:</b> One of the method is getElementById().This method is used  to "find" 
             an HTML element (with id="demo") and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript" <br>
             2. <b>It can change HTML attribute values</b> <br>
             3. <b>It can change HTML styles</b> <br>
             4. <b>It can show and hide HTML elements</b> <br>
              </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT WHERE TO</h3>  JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML. The javascript codes are inserted 
            in between the script tags. You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
            Scripts can be placed in the body or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.   
            Scripts can be placed in external files.
            External scripts can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT OUTPUT</h3> 
        Javascript can display data in different ways. This include: <br>
        1. <b>Using innerHTML</b> <br>
        2. <b>Using document.write()</b> <br>
        3. <b>Uding window.alert()</b> <br>
        4. <b>Using console.log()</b> <br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT STATEMENTS</h3>  JavaScript statements are composed of:
            Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments. The statements are executed, one by one, in the
             same order as they are written. JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript 
             action to be performed. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX</h3>  JavaScripts syntax are sets of rules that shows how JavaScript programs are
            constructed. The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values.
            Fixed values are called literals. Variable values are called variables.
             JavaScript is case sensitive. It uses strings, operators, expression, keyword and identifers.  </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT COMMENTS</h3>  In JavaScript comments are used to give explain JavaScript code and to make
             it more readable.
             <b> Single line comments start with //.</b>  <br>
             <b>Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.</b>
             Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
            
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES</h3> Variables are containers for storing data.
        All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
        These unique names are called identifiers.
        Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
        The equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operatorin JavaScript not an "equal to" operator.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT OPERATORS</h3>  There are various types 
        of operators. This include the assignment operator, increment operator, logical operator,
        expomentiation, string operators, comparison operators etc
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT ARITHMENTIC</h3> Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables). 
            Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.
            Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).
            And the precedence can be changed by using parentheses.
