    <div><h2>Java script Lesson 1</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT HOME</h3>
            JavaScript is easy language to learn. it is the
            programming language of HTML and the Web. Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used.
            Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Also Javascript and Java are completely different languages. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT INTRODUCTION</h3> Javascript can do a lot of things. Examples include <br>
             1. <b> Javascript can change HTML content:</b> One of the method is getElementById().This method is used  to "find" 
             an HTML element (with id="demo") and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript" <br>
             2. <b>It can change HTML attribute values</b> <br>
             3. <b>It can change HTML styles</b> <br>
             4. <b>It can show and hide HTML elements</b> <br>
              </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT WHERE TO</h3>  JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML. The javascript codes are inserted 
            in between the script tags. You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
            Scripts can be placed in the body or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.   
            Scripts can be placed in external files.
            External scripts can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT OUTPUT</h3> 
        Javascript can display data in different ways. This include: <br>
        1. <b>Using innerHTML</b> <br>
        2. <b>Using document.write()</b> <br>
        3. <b>Uding window.alert()</b> <br>
        4. <b>Using console.log()</b> <br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT STATEMENTS</h3>  JavaScript statements are composed of:
            Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments. The statements are executed, one by one, in the
             same order as they are written. JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript 
             action to be performed. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> <h3>JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX</h3>  JavaScripts syntax are sets of rules that shows how JavaScript programs are
            constructed. The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values.
            Fixed values are called literals. Variable values are called variables.
             JavaScript is case sensitive. It uses strings, operators, expression, keyword and identifers.  </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT COMMENTS</h3>  In JavaScript comments are used to give explain JavaScript code and to make
             it more readable.
             <b> Single line comments start with //.</b>  <br>
             <b>Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.</b>
             Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
            
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES</h3> Variables are containers for storing data.
        All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
        These unique names are called identifiers.
        Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
        The equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operatorin JavaScript not an "equal to" operator.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT OPERATORS</h3>  There are various types 
        of operators. This include the assignment operator, increment operator, logical operator,
        expomentiation, string operators, comparison operators etc
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT ARITHMENTIC</h3> Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables). 
            Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.
            Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).
            And the precedence can be changed by using parentheses.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT ASSIGNMENT</h3> Assignment operators assign values to variables. These operators include =, +=,
        -=, *=, >>>= etc.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPES</h3> JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects etc.
        JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.
        It is important to note that JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS</h3> A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
        The function is executed when it called. It is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
        Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
        The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
        (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
        The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS</h3> JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.
        Objects are also variables. But objects can contain many values. The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
        In defining an object, spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines. <br>
        <b>Object Properties:</b> The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties. <br>
        Object properties can be accessed in two ways. <br>
           1. objectName.propertyName <br>
           2. objectName["propertyName"] <br> 
        <b>Object Methods:</b> Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. They are stored in properties as function definitions.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT EVENTS</h3> Events are "things" that happens.
        JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
        HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
        Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT STRINGS</h3> JavaScript strings are used for storing and manipulating text.
        A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes(It could be single''or double quotes "").
        But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword 'new'.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT STRING METHODS</h3> String methods helps to work with strings. There are different methods in carrying out operations like String length,
         Finding a string in a string, Searching for a string in a string and Extracting string parts.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT NUMBERS</h3> Numbers can be with or without decimals. Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponent) notation.
         Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits in JavaScript. <br>
         JavaScript uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation.
         Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.<br>
         <b>Numeric Strings:</b>
         JavaScript strings can have numeric content. Strings will be converted to numbers in all numeric operations except with the + operator.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT NUMBER METHODS</h3> Number methods help you work with numbers. There are a number of methods that can be use with Javascript.Examples are <br>
         <b>1. The toString() Method:</b> this method returns a number as a string.<br>
         <b>2. The toExponential() Method:</b> this method returns a string, with a number rounded and written using exponential notation.<br>
         <b>3. The toFixed() Method:</b>this method returns a string, with the number written with a specified number of decimals. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT ARRAYS</h3> JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. An array can be created using the syntax:
        var array_name = [item1, item2, ...]. An array can be accessed by using the index number. The indexes start with 0.[0] is the first element. 
        [1] is the second element.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
       <h3>JAVASCRIPT ARRAY METHODS</h3>  <p><b>The toString() method and The join() method</b> converts an array to a string of array values.
         Popping items out of an array can be achieved by using <b>The pop() method </b> which removes the last element from an array. Pushing items
         can be achieved by using <b>The push() method </b> which adds a new element to an array (at the end).
         <b>The shift() method</b> removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index. There are other methods that can be applied
         to and array such as the <b>unshift() method, splice(), concat(), slice() </b>etc.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT ARRAY SORT</h3><p><b>The sort() method</b> sorts an array alphabetically and it sorts values as strings.</p><b>The reverse() method </b>reverses the elements in an array.
         It can also be used to sort an array in descending order. <p><b>Numeric Sort:</b> The sort() method will produce incorrect result when sorting numbers.Therefore
         numbers are sorted by providing a compare function. For example this function will sort the numbers in ascending other. function myFunction() {
         points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});</p>
         <p><b>The Compare Function</b> The purpose of the compare function is to define an alternative sort order.The compare function should return a negative, zero,
         or positive value, depending on the arguments.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
       <h3>JAVASCRIPT ARRAY ITERATION</h3> 
         <ul>
            <li><b>Array.forEach()</b> method calls a function once for each element in the array.</li>
            <li><b>Array.map()</b> method creates a new array by performing a function on each array element. It does not execute the function for array elements without 
                values and does not change the original array.</li>
            <li><b>Array.filter()</b> method creates a new array with array elements that passes a test.</li>
            <li><b>Array.reduce()</b> method runs a function on each array element to reduce it to a single value. This works from left to right and does not reduce the original array.<br>
            <b>Array.reduceRight()</b> works from right to left.</li>
            <li><b>Array.every()</b> method checks if all array value pass a test.</li>
            <li><b>Array.some()</b> method checks if some array values pass a test.</li>
            <li><b>Array.indexOf()</b> method searches an array for an element value and returns its position.The first item has position 0, the second item has position 1, and so on.</li>
            <li><b>Array.lastIndexOf()</b> method searches from the end of the array.</li>
            <li><b>Array.find()</b> method returns the value of the first array element that passes a test function.</li>
            <li><b>Array.findIndex()</b> method returns the index of the first array element that passes a test function.</li>
         </ul>    
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT DATES</h3> JavaScript stores dates as number of milliseconds since January 01, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated).
        Date objects are created with the new Date() constructor.Date objects are static. The computer time is ticking, but date objects are not.<br>
        JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11. January is 0. December is 11.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT DATE FORMATS</h3> There are generally 3 types of JavaScript date input formats. they are
        <ul>
            <li>ISO Date: "2020-08-02"(The International Standard) </li>
            <li>Short Date: "08/02/2020"</li>
            <li>Long Date: "AUG 2 2020"</li>
        </ul>
        Independent of input format, JavaScript will (by default) output dates in full text string format.
          <p>For example:Tue Mar 30 2012 03:00:00 GMT+0200 (West Africa Standard Time)</p>
      <br>
      <b>JavaScript ISO Dates</b>      
      ISO 8601 is the international standard for the representation of dates and times.<br>
      The ISO 8601 syntax (YYYY-MM-DD) is also the preferred JavaScript date format.                      
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT DATE GET METHODS</h3>

                </tr>
               
            </table>
        <p>In JavaScript, the first day of the week (0) means "Sunday", even if some countries in the world consider the first day of the week to be "Monday"</p>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT DATE SET METHODS</h3> Data set methods are used for setting a part of a date.
        <table>
                <tr>
                    <th> <b>Method</b> </th>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT MATH</h3> The JavaScript Math object allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
        <b>Math.round()</b>:rounds to nearest interger.<br>
        <b>Math.pow(a,b)</b>:returns the value of a to the power of b.<br>
        <b>Math.sqrt()</b>:returns squareroot.<br>
        <b>Math.ceil()</b>: rounds up to nearest interger.</br>
        <b>Math.abs()</b>: returns absolute(positive) value.<br>
        <b>Math.floor()</b>: rounds down to nearest interger.<br>
        <b>Math.sin()</b>: returns sine of an angle in radians.<br>
        <b>Math.cos()</b>: returns cosine of an angle in radians.<br>
        <b>Math.min()</b> and <b>Math.max()</b>: returns the lowest and highest values respectively.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT RANDOM</h3> <b>Math.random( )</b>: returns random number between 0(inclusive) and 1(exclusive).It always returns a number lower than 1.<br>
        <b>JavaScript Random Integers</b>: Math.random() used with Math.floor() can be used to return random integers.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT BOOLEANS</h3>A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.<br>
        <b>The Boolean() Function</b>: is used to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true. for example: Boolean(20 > 11)    // returns true<br>
        The Boolean value of an expression is the basis for all JavaScript comparisons and conditions.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT COMPARISONS</h3> Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for true or false.<br>
         <b>Comparison operators</br> are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between values.
         Comparision operation include 
         <ul>
             <li> Equal to (==)</li>
             <li>Equal value and equal type (===) </li>
             <li>Not equal (!=) </li>
             <li>Not equal value or not equal type (!==)</li>
             <li>Greater than or equal to (>=) </li> etc.
         </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p><h3>JAVASCRIPT CONDITIONS</h3> Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.<br>
         In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
         <ul>      
            <li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
            <li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
            <li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
            <li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
         </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT SWITCH</h3><p>The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. <br> 
    The switch expression is evaluated once.
    The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
    If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
    If there is no match, the default code block is executed. <br>
        <b>The break Keyword:</b>When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.This will stop the execution of inside the block.
        If you omit the break statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does not match the case.
        </p>
</div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT LOOP FOR</h3> Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.They can be used to run a code over again with different values.<br>
        For example instead of writing
        text += cars[0] + "<br>"; 
        text += cars[1] + "<br>";
        text += cars[2] + "<br>";
        text += cars[3] + "<br>";
        text += cars[4] + "<br>";
        text += cars[5] + "<br>";
               You can write: <br>
             var i;<br>
             for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
             text += cars[i] + "<br>";
             } 
                     <br>                     
            <b>Different Kinds of Loops</b> <br>
      JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
     <ul>
          <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
          <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
          <li>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
          <li> while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
          <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
      </ul>   
                    
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT LOOP WHILE</h3> 
        <p>Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
         The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.<br>
            Syntax<br>
            while (condition) {
            // code block to be executed
            }
            <br>
            If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, the loop will never end. This will crash your browser.<br>
            <b>The Do/While Loop</b><br>
            The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once,
            before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.<br>
              Syntax<br>
            do {
            // code block to be executed
             } <br>
            while (condition);
        </p>
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT BREAK</h3> 
        <p><b>The break statement</b> "jumps out" of a loop.It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.<br>
             <b>The continue statement</b> "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified
              condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.<br>
            The break and the continue statements are the only JavaScript statements that can "jump out of" a code block.<br>
            A code block is a block of code between { and }.

        </p>
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT TYPE CONVERSION</h3> 
        <p>Number() converts to a Number, String() converts to a String, Boolean() converts to a Boolean. <br>
            <b>JavaScript Data Types</b>
      <ul>
        <p>5 different data types that can contain values:</p>
        <li>String</li>
        <li>Number</li>
        <li>Boolean</li>
        <li>Function</li>
        <li>Object</li>

        <p>2 data types that cannot contain values:</p>
        <li>Null</li>
        <li>Undefined</li>

        <p>3 types of objects:</p>
        <li>Object</li>
        <li>Date</li>
        <li>Array</li>
        </ul>
    <b>NOTE:</b> <br>The data type of NaN is number<br>
    The data type of null is object<br>
    The data type of an undefined variable is undefined <br>
    
    
    <b>JavaScript Type Conversion</b><br>
    JavaScript variables can be converted to a new variable and another data type:<br>
    1. By the use of a JavaScript function<br>
    2. Automatically by JavaScript itself<br>

        </p>
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT BITWISE</h3> 
        <p>JavaScript stores numbers as 64 bits floating point numbers, but all bitwise operations are performed on 32 bits binary numbers. 
            Before a bitwise operation is performed, JavaScript converts numbers to 32 bits signed integers.After the bitwise operation is performed, 
            the result is converted back to 64 bits JavaScript numbers.<br>

<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT REGULAR EXPRESSION</h3> 
        <p>A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations.<br> 
            A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern. It can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.<br> 
            Syntax<br> 
            <i>/pattern/modifiers; </i> <br>
            <b>Regular Expression Modifiers</b><br>
            <p><b>i</b> is a modifier that modifies the search to be case-insensitive.<br>
        <b>g</b> modifier performs a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match).<br>
        <b>m</b> modifier performs multiline matching.</p>
           
        </p> 
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT ERRORS</h3> 
        <p>When executing JavaScript code, different errors can occur. <br>
            The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors.<br>
             The catch statement lets you handle the error.<br>
              The throw statement lets you create custom errors.<br>
              The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.<br>
            <b>The Error Object</b>: a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs.The error object provides two useful properties:<br>
            <b>1. Name</b> which sets or returns an error name<br>
            <b>2. message</b> which sets or returns an error message (a string)<br>
            <b>Error Name Values</b><>br
            Six different values can be returned by the error name property. They are:<br>
            <b>EvalError</br> An error has occurred in the eval() function<br>
            <b>RangeError</br> A number "out of range" has occurred<br>
            <b>ReferenceError</br> An illegal reference has occurred<br>
            <b>SyntaxError</br>A syntax error has occurred<br>
            <b>TypeError</br> A type error has occurred<br>
            <b>URIError</br> An error in encodeURI() has occurred<br>

           Newer versions of JavaScript do not throw EvalError. It uses SyntaxError instead.
        </p>
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT SCOPE</h3> 
        <p>Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code.
         Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.<br>
         In JavaScript there are two types of scope:
         <ul>
           <li>Local scope</li>
           <li>Global scope</li>
          </ul>
    <b>Local JavaScript Variables</b><br>
    Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
    Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the function.They are created when a function starts,
    and deleted when the function is completed.<br>
    <b>Global JavaScript Variables</b><br>
    A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.
    A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it.<br>
    If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.
        </p>
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT HOISTING</h3> Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top. A variable can be declared after it has been used.
         Variables and constants declared with <i>let</i> or <i>const</i> are not hoisted!<br>
         JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT STRICT MODE</h3> 
        <p>Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function. Declared at the beginning of a script, 
            it has global scope (all code in the script will execute in strict mode). It is not a statement, but a literal expression, 
            ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.Strict mode can be used for all programs. It helps to write cleaner code and also prevents undeclared variables.<br>
            Keywords reserved for future JavaScript versions can NOT be used as variable names in strict mode.<br>
            They are:<br>
            <ul>
            <li> implements</li>
                <li> interface</li>
                <li> let</li>
                <li>  package</li>
                <li>  private</li>
                <li>  protected</li>
                <li>  public</li>
                <li> static</li>
                <li>  yield</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT THIS KEYWORD</h3> 
        <p>The JavaScript <b>this</b> keyword refers to the object it belongs to.<br>
      It has different values depending on where it is used:<br>
    In a method, this refers to the owner object.<br>
    Alone, <b>this</b> refers to the global object.<br>
    In a function, <b>this</b> refers to the global object.<br>
    In a function, in strict mode, <b>this</b> is undefined.<br>
    In an event, <b>this</b> refers to the element that received the event.<br>
    Methods like call(), and apply() can refer <b>this</b> to any object.<br>

        </p>
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT LET</h3> 
        <p>ES2015 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords:<b>let</b> and <b>const</b>.<br>
         Variables declared with the <b>let</b> keyword can have Block Scope.<br>
         Variables declared with var and <b>let</b> are quite similar when declared inside a function.
          They will both have Function Scope.<br>
         In a loop using <b>let</b>the variable declared in the loop does not redeclare the variable outside the loop. 
        </p>
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT CONST</h3> 
        <p>The keyword const is a little misleading.
        It does NOT define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
        Because of this, we cannot change constant primitive values, but we can change the properties of constant objects. A constant object can NOT be reassign.<br>
        Constant arrays can change but cannot be reasigned.
        </p>
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT ARROW FUNCTION</h3> 
        <p>Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax.<br>
            BEFORE: hello = function() {
  return "Hello World!";
            <br>
            With Arrow Function:hello = () &rAarr; {
  return "Hello World!";
} 
        </p>
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT DEBUGGING</h3> 
        <p>Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs.
        The first known computer bug was a real bug (an insect) stuck in the electronics. Modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.<br>
        <b>console.log( )</b> can be used to display JavaScript values in the debugger window when using a browser that supports debugging.
        The <b>debugger</b> keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls the debugging function.
        </p>
    </div>
<div>
        <h3>JAVASCRIPT STYLE GUIDE</h3> 
        <p>Coding conventions are <b>style guidelines</b> for programming. They typically cover:<br>
        1.  Naming and declaration rules for variables and functions.<br>
        2. Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments.<br>
        3. Programming practices and principles<br>

       Coding conventions secure quality<br>
       Improves code readability<br>
       Make code maintenance easier<br>

Coding conventions can be documented rules for teams to follow, or just be your individual coding practice.

        <h3>JAVASCRIPT MISTAKES</h3> 
        <p><b>Some common JavaScript mistakes include:</b><br>
            1. Accidentally Using the Assignment Operator<br> 
            2. Expecting Loose Comparison<br>
            3. Confusing Addition & Concatenation<br>
            4. Misunderstanding Floats <br>
            5. Breaking a JavaScript String<br>
            6. Misplacing Semicolon<br>
            7. Breaking a Return Statement<br>
            8. Explanation<br>
            9. Accessing Arrays with Named Indexes<br>
            10. Ending Definitions with a Comma<br>
            11. Undefined is Not Null<br>
